**Shitting Bricks Simulator** is a series of games revolving around the
titular concept developed by [Nwge Game Studio].

## Installments

### Shitting Bricks Simulator 2022

**SBS2022** is the original installment from the series. It was never publicly
released. Unlike its successor, it was developed using [Godot].

The gameplay is rather simple. The player must press on the "Push" button to
increase the amount of effort put into pushing the brick out. The more effort is
put in, the more oxygen is used. If the player runs out of oxygen, they lose a
bunch of progress and must wait for the oxygen to regenerate. There is no
progression in the game.

### Shitting Bricks Simulator 2024

**SBS2024** is the latest installment from the series. It is developed using
[nwge].

> SBS2024 is no longer playable starting January 1st, 2025. Thank you for
> playing!

The gameplay is similar to that of SBS2022. The player may click anywhere on the
screen to push the brick. Alike the original, the more effort is put in, the
more oxygen is used. Once the player manages to push the brick out, they gain 1
point. It is then possible to spend these points in the store to make it easier
to push the brick out.

Upgrades available in the store are:

* **Chinese Lube** (10 points), which decreases the amount of effort needed to
  push out the brick.
* **Super Lube** (15 points), which further decreases the amount of effort
  needed to push out the brick.
* **Gravity Intensifier** (25 points), which makes the brick move downwards
  slightly.
* **Mini Black Hole** (35 points), which further increases the gravitational
  pull on the brick.
* **Supermassive Black Hole** (50 points), which ends the game.

After beating the game for the first time, a new item will appear in the store:

* **Inhaler** (40 points), which removes the penalty for running out of oxygen.

The game features 2 characters:

* [Butt McCrack], the protagonist of the game.
* The [Cool Evil Wizard], the antagonist. He is never seen in the game, only
  mentioned in an e-mail viewable from the Extras menu after beating the game.

The initial release of the game used nwge v0.11. The version of nwge would then
be incremented with each update. For example, v1.3 used nwge v0.13. The final
update, v1.5, broke this pattern by staying on nwge v0.14.
