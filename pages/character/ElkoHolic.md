**Elko Holić** (sometimes spelled *Kólyti*) was the leader of the 1st Southern
Division of the Umeg Campaign.

## Early Life

Not much is known about his early life. He was born on August 22nd, 1947 in
Yugoslavia, modern-day Croatia. He was born to a Yugoslav father and a Tareen
mother. After his father's death in 1950, his mother moved back to Cógandayia,
Tareenia with him. There, they adopted the surname "Kólyti" but he would go on
to primarily use his father's surname instead.

His mother applied for him to be granted a Tareen citizenship. It is not clear
whether it was granted to him, as different governments handled his particular
case differently. The New Temporary Government of Cógandayia recognized him as a
Tareen citizen on the basis of his mother being Tareen. The Cógandayiané
Kolóperatné Ként never acknowledged the application. The People's Government of
Western Tareenia rejected the application, but the Reintegrated Tareen
Government of the Western Tareen People accepted it. His citizenship would
finally be recognized by the Cooperative Tykian-Tareen Government when he was
recruited for mandatory military service at the age of 20. He never ended up
serving in the military, due to various bureaucratic issues.

## Service in Umeg Campaign

He was part of the Umeg Campaign formed after [Mykál Umeg]'s death. Documentation
later revealed he was one of the first people to be recruited for the Southern
Group. At first, he was a regular troop of the 1st division, but would become
the technological assistant by 1969. In 1971 he would become the "right-hand" of
the division's leader and finally become the leader of the division in 1972.

The 1st division would receive instruction about construction of a new Falwerk
center in the city of Roskné Komata. They were instructed to "halt the
construction and execute anyone who tries to stop them". The troops of the 1st
division would gather on the outskirts of the city on June 3rd, 1974 before
finally storming onto the construction site. They were surprised by the lack of
any construction equipment and a group of Tykian operatives instead. The Tykians
would then open fire, killing 3 and wounding 7 troops. The Umeg Campaign
division would retreat due to the leader's death. It is reported that Holić's
last words were "Nyz benówel e zut." ("Nothing will be, then." in Tareen, a
translation of the Flamian phrase "Nik vel bet, zut.").

His death would be commemorated by Juljan Sóbaj, who granted him a posthumous
Order of Sejus (Sezúsné Ord) on August 1st, 1975.
