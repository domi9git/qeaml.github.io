**Géi** is a major character appearing in **Emesis Red** and **Emesis Purple**.
He is a police officer. He is potentially in a gay relationship with [Walter].

## Story

### Emesis Red

In Emesis Red he initially recruits [Speed Dealer Officer Police] to deal speed
to his fellow teammates. After enough speed was distributed, he killed the
dealer with the assistance of [Drug Dealer Officer Police].

### Emesis Purple

In Chapter 1, he finds that Drug Dealer Officer Police faked his death and
finally kills him by stabbing him in the back and throwing him into a chasm.

In the later half of Chapter 1, he finds a weapon dealing operation ran by
Walter in the sewers. He did not know that Walter was responsible for it,
causing him to be confused when he revels his identity to the dealer. Géi
mentions that the two of them were supposed to adopt a child, implying they are
in a gay relationship. He ends up arresting Walter anyway.

At the end of Chapter 2 he is thrown into a fire by a RED Pyro and is presumed
dead.

## Appearance

Géi takes the appearance of a BLU Spy, wearing an outfit reminiscent of Jotaro
Kujo. His is played by [clueless].
